# Bus Passenger Forecasting

**Project Overview**  
This project applies **Facebook Prophet**, a powerful time-series forecasting model, to predict daily bus passenger volumes. The goal is to analyze historical trends and forecast demand to help improve scheduling and operational efficiency.

**Key Features**
- Cleaned and preprocessed historical passenger data for analysis.  
- Implemented **Prophet** for time-series forecasting and trend analysis.  
- Visualized predictions, seasonal patterns, and forecast accuracy.  
- Provided insights on passenger demand peaks and long-term trends.

**Tech Stack**
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries:** Prophet, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

**Results**
- Generated reliable short-term and long-term forecasts.  
- Identified seasonal trends and daily variations in passenger flow.  
- Demonstrated the usefulness of Prophet for real-world transport demand prediction.

**Future Improvements**
- Integrate real-time data updates and external factors (weather, holidays).  
- Deploy forecasting model via API or dashboard for continuous monitoring.
